# HomeworkHelperWebCrawler
Web crawler that returns 'answers' for an array of 'questions' which are broken up to make into urls to feed to search engine, and then have the HTML of the google page parsed to. 

**How to run for thsoe interested**

Simply download the WebCrawler.java file and run in either IntelliJ or Eclipse and in the terminal/command line it will ask you to "Enter Questions" and enter your respective questions seperated by commas. This program is meant to answer a big list of "questions" quickly by parsing HTML pages and then print out your question's answers in the terminal. It was originally made as a "homework helper" in quarantine out of curiosity and boredom and can be implemented outside of simple questions but alongside other tools like data parsing(e.g. my stockshelper repository).
